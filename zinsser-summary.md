#Zinsser, _On Writing Well_, Chapters 2-3

Summary by Ryan Phung

“Writing is hard work”, Zinsser says. In chapters two and three, he mentions the importance of writing simply. It involves removing unnecessary words or phrases which he considers is “clutter.” By removing such clutter in one’s writing, the writer is able to achieve conciseness. Concise writing is preferred because it does not bore the reader. Its message to convey is clearer. There is no need to use long words or sentence fragments when these can be shorten to simpler words. However, simplicity in writing takes practice. Just remember that shorter ways of saying things are always possible.
